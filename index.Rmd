# Disclaimer and Attribution

**I claim absolutely no credit for this visualization, which I consider one of the most instructive I have ever seen.  If anybody believes this to be not fair use, I will take it down immediately.  I am implicitly assuming approval for this due to the interview http://datastori.es/data-stories-22-nyt-graphics-and-d3-with-mike-bostock-and-shan-carter/.** 

```{r echo=F, warning= F, message=F}

  'templates',
